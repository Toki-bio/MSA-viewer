Scale bar & block number at top of each block
➤ Show position range (e.g., 1–80) and block number above each block for easy navigation.
Add consensus sequence line
➤ Display a dynamically generated consensus row (e.g., using IUPAC codes) below the sequences in each block.
Support MSF format input
➤ Parse .msf (GCG Multiple Sequence Format) in addition to FASTA.
Make menu more compact
➤ Reduce vertical space in controls; stack elements efficiently to maximize sequence viewing area.
Enable conservation level edits in fullscreen mode
➤ Allow sliders (Black/Dark/Light thresholds) to remain accessible and functional when menu is minimized or in fullscreen view.
Set "Shade By: All Sites" as default
➤ Change default shading mode to include gaps in denominator (more accurate for low-coverage regions).
Highlight exact feature (e.g., click-to-highlight sequence region)
➤ Allow clicking a sequence to highlight a column or region (e.g., residue 50–70) across all sequences.
Realign selected sequences within current block
➤ Add option to realign only selected sequences in the current block (not full alignment), preserving local structure.
